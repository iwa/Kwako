# Premium

This page will explain what the purpose of the Premium Access is, what is unlocks and how you can get it.

### Why a Premium Access?

Kwako is a really fun project to work on. But hosting the bot has a price, and it can easily become a really significant cost, especially for a student.

I launched my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/iwa) in order to let people financially support me, in exchange for some perks. And one of them is Premium Access.

### What does the Premium Access give?

The Premium Access means having access to all the new features before everyone else.

When a new feature is released, it's released as Premium-only feature.
Only the Premium-enabled servers can use it.

The feature will then be made publicly available a few weeks after.

### How to get Premium-enabled?

If you want to support my work, first of all let me thank you for your generosity!

In order to enable a server as Premium, the owner needs to [become a Patron](https://www.patreon.com/iwa/join). After a few minutes, every server the user owns will be Premium-enabled.

!> When becoming a Patron, be sure to link your Discord account to your Patreon account in order to enable your Premium Access. Otherwise it won't work.
