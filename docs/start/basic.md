# Basic bot setup

This page will explain how to get a basic setup of Kwako.

### 1. Invite the bot
First of all, you need to invite the bot through [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize/?permissions=305523776&amp;scope=bot&amp;client_id=630488699347533854).

?> **Note:** Please ensure that Kwako has all the necessary perms, or the bot might not fully work.

### 2. Setup the bot
Kwako is fully customizable, from the prefix to reactions roles messages.
You can manage the bot thanks to the `!config` command.

Send `!config edit` in a channel, and wait until all the reactions has appeared before continuing.

**Note:** You need to either be the owner or have the 'Manage Server' permission in order to manage the configuration of Kwako in a server.
